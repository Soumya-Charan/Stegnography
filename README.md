# üñºÔ∏è **Steganography Tool: Hide Secrets in Images**  

Welcome to the **Steganography Tool**! This Python-based application lets you hide secret messages inside images and retrieve them later‚Äîall while keeping your data safe and secure. Whether you're a privacy enthusiast, a student, or just someone who loves cool tech, this tool is for you.

## ‚ú® **Features**  

### **What Can You Do?**  
- **Hide Messages:** Embed text messages into any image without visibly altering it.  
- **Retrieve Secrets:** Extract hidden messages using a secure passcode.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple Tkinter-based GUI makes the process easy and intuitive.  
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  

### **How It Works**  
- **Encryption:**  
  - Each character of your message is converted to its ASCII value.  
  - The values are embedded into the image pixels using a diagonal embedding method.  
  - The modified image is saved as a lossless PNG file.  
- **Decryption:**  
  - The program reads the pixel values and reconstructs the hidden message.  
  - A passcode ensures only authorized users can access the message.
